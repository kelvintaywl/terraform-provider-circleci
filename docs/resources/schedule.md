# circleci_schedule (Resource)

Manages a project's schedule

**Note**: Scheduled pipelines are currently [not supported for standalone projects](https://circleci.com/docs/github-apps-integration/#scheudled-pipelines).

Please see [the official CircleCI documentation for more information](https://circleci.com/docs/scheduled-pipelines/).

## Example Usage

### Weekly schedule

```terraform
resource "circleci_schedule" "weekly_schedule" {
  project_slug = "github/acmeorg/foobar"
  name         = "Weekly schedule"
  description  = "Runs every Monday at 00:00~ UTC"
  branch       = "main"
  timetable = {
    per_hour     = 1
    hours_of_day = [0]
    days_of_week = ["MON"]
    // we do not declare months here;
    // defaults to all months
  }
  // using the Scheduling system user
  actor = "system"
}
```

### Specific days of the month

This example showcases how to set up the pipeline parameters using `jsonencode` as well.

```terraform
resource "circleci_schedule" "every_first_day_of_quarter" {
  project_slug = "github/acmeorg/foobar"
  name         = "Quarterly schedule"
  description  = "Runs every 1st day of the quarter at 15:00~ UTC"
  branch       = "release"
  parameters = jsonencode({
    my_str  = "fizzbuzz"
    my_int  = 123
    my_bool = true
  })
  timetable = {
    per_hour      = 1
    hours_of_day  = [15]
    days_of_month = [1]
    months = [
      "JAN",
      "APR",
      "JUL",
      "OCT",
    ]
  }
  // refers to the owner of the CircleCI API token
  actor = "current"
}
```

```
