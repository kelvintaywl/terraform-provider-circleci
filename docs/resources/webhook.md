  // "circleci/<org random string>/<project random string>"

}

resource "circleci_webhook" "my_webhook" {
  project_id     = data.circleci_project.my_project.id
  name           = "my_webhook"
  url            = "https://example.com/hook"
  signing_secret = "5uperSeCr3t!"
  verify_tls     = true
  events = [
    // accepts only "workflow-completed" and "job-completed"
    "job-completed",
    "workflow-completed"
