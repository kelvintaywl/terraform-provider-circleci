# (Unofficial) Terraform Provider for CircleCI

[![CircleCI](https://dl.circleci.com/status-badge/img/gh/kelvintaywl/terraform-provider-circleci/tree/main.svg?style=shield)](https://dl.circleci.com/status-badge/redirect/gh/kelvintaywl/terraform-provider-circleci/tree/main)

## Usage

To use this provider, refer to https://registry.terraform.io/providers/kelvintaywl/circleci/latest

The rest of the README is mainly focused on how to develop on this source code.

## Example

See [sandbox](sandbox/main.tf)

## Development

```console
# this project uses go 1.19
$ go mod download

# or, if you want to upgrade the Go dependencies too
$ go get -u
$ go mod tidy

# to build the go binary, and "install" to your local provider directory
# NOTE: this is a one-time action
$ make init

# whenever we make changes to the code
$ make build
# this then tries to terraform apply the sandbox
$ make tf.plan

# when you are ready to apply
$ make tf.apply

# destroy, as needed
$ make tf.destroy
```

## Testing

We run acceptance tests against an actual CircleCI organizations and projects:

| Type | Org | Project |
| --- | --- | --- |
| GitHub OAuth | https://github.com/kelvintaywl-tf | https://github.com/kelvintaywl-tf/tf-provider-acceptance-test-dummy |
| Gitlab (standalone) | https://gitlab.com/ktwl411/ | https://gitlab.com/ktwl411/loren-ipsum |

```console
# Run acceptance tests
$ export CIRCLE_TOKEN="user API token that can manage the organization and project"
$ make testacc
```

This is so as to contain the "blast radius" of the acceptance tests.
In worst case, this organization and project is affected, but not more.

In addition, the CircleCI API token used belongs to a [user](https://github.com/orgs/kelvintaywl-tf/people/ktwl41) that is not tied to [my main CircleCI user account](http://github.com/kelvintaywl).

## Docs

```console
# to generate docs
# check docs/index.md
$ make docs
```

See [docs](docs/index.md)

## Releasing

Currently, we release locally with [GoReleaser](https://goreleaser.com/install/).
The config can be found in [.goreleaser.yml](.goreleaser.yml)

```console
# NOTE: make sure documents are generated!

# tag release
$ git tag vX.Y.Z -m "some message"

# install GoReleaser on MacOS if required
# See https://goreleaser.com/install/
$ brew install goreleaser/tap/goreleaser

# set required env vars
$ export GITHUB_TOKEN="your GitHub Token value, with public_repo scope required"
$ export GPG_FINGERPRINT="your GPG fingerprint, registered to your Terraform namespace"
# optional
$ export GPG_TTY=$(tty)

# make a GitHub release (with artifacts),
# via GoReleaser
$ goreleaser release --clean
```

## Notes

This depends on a CircleCI Go SDK I (auto) generated:
https://github.com/kelvintaywl/circleci-go-sdk


## Why this is taking longer than I expected

1. I am unfortunately not a Go programmer. See [Hashicorp's stance on support for other languages here](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/plugin/sdkv2/best-practices/other-languages)
2. There is [a template you are encouraged to use](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-scaffolding-framework) but the internal implementation is missing, so not knowing how to use [the framework](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-framework) and Go makes it tougher.
3. The provided [framework (SDK)](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-framework) is new, so older providers are not using it, which also makes it difficult to refer to example codes.
